To-do:

1: Make sure the textreader and the various constants in Main can handle
different kind of textfiles. At the very least the two different ones that
we get now.

2: Test wether drawing multiple plots onto one applet works with the same parameters,
moving them with scale() and translate(). Start with one extra.

3: Move on to the other scatterplots, add a (sub)class for the informative
rectangles.

4: Draw meta-information.

5: Profit!
